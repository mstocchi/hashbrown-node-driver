## Prerequisites
For this example, we'll be using express and the [HashBrown node.js driver](https://github.com/Putaitu/hashbrown-node-driver).  
We need the `body-parser` package to allow pushing content changes, as they are consumed via a REST API.  
In this example, we're using EJS for templating, but that's up to you.  
A major advantage of EJS is that it supports dynamic includes, which we'll be using.

Make sure you have the latest stable version of HashBrown, and that it's running

When you've cloned this repo, install the dependencies and start the server:
```bash
$ npm install
$ node index.js
```

## Create the project
- Create a new project in the dashboard and call it "node.js example"

![Creating a section Schema](_readme/create-section-schema.png)
- Type "Section" into the name field
- Pick a fancy icon

- Use this config:
```json
{
    "struct": {
        "template": {
            "label": "Template",
            "schemaId": "templateReference",
            "config": {
                "type": "partial",
                "allowedTemplates": ["section"]
            }
        },
        "image": {
            "label": "Image",
            "schemaId": "mediaReference"
        },
        "text": {
            "label": "Text",
            "schemaId": "richText"
        }
    }
}
```
- Click "save"

### Section Page Schema
- Create a new Schema as a child of the "Page" Schema and name it "Section Page"

- Use these fields:
```json
{
    "template": {
        "label": "Template",
        "schemaId": "templateReference",
        "tabId": "content",
        "config": {
            "allowedTemplates": ["sectionPage"],
            "type": "page"
        }
    },
    "sections": {
        "label": "Sections",
        "tabId": "content",
        "schemaId": "array",
        "config": {
            "allowedSchemas": ["THE_ID_OF_YOUR_SECTION_SCHEMA"]
        }
    }
}
```
- To get the id of your "Section" Schema, just right click it and select "copy id"
- Click "save"

## Create the Content
- In the "Content" pane, create a new Content node

![Selecting a publishing connection](_readme/select-connection.png)
